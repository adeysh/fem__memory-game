- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For Styles

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For Icons

### What I learned

- Learned how to architecture a big app with a lot of files and components.
- How to manage a centralized state and functionality throughout the app.
- How to centralize constants and reuse them throughout the app.
- How to use Font Awesome svg icons in a react app.
- How to derive dynamic classes based on conditionals, props, boolean states.
- How to reuse components throughout the app.
- Using reducer/actions to manage multiple states.
- Saving and Updating/Loading state saved in localStorage.
- Responsive behavior on different screen sizes.

### Continued development

- Probably be using Next.js to create this project fast.
- Use a popular state management library here (Redux).
